# Personal finance planner

This is a tool that helps people to enhance their financial health assessing their monthly personal finances, and also being able to forecast a reasonably good retirement plan based on cryptocurrencies, stocks, and bonds.

The first part will be a personal finance planner that will allow users to visualize their savings composed by investments in shares and cryptocurrencies to assess if they have enough money as an emergency fund.

The second part will be a retirement planning tool that will use the Alpaca API to fetch historical closing prices for a retirement portfolio composed of stocks and bonds, then run Monte Carlo simulations to project the portfolio performance at 30 years, 10 years and 5 years. Finally, using the Monte Carlo data, the tool calculates the expected portfolio returns given a specific initial investment amount.
